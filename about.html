<h3><b>What is Shi.Kyu?</b></h3>

<p>Shi.Kyu is the first online Android Netrunner cube draft simulation website. </p>

<h3><b>What?</b></h3>

<p>Alright, so many collectable card games feature a mode of play called “drafting” where you have to build a deck using a significantly reduced card pool. It typically works by getting players to sit in a circle and select cards against each other in a draft. This style of play works in CCGs because players then get to keep the cards they used in the draft.</p>

<p>For Living Card Games (LCGs) like Android Netrunner, players typically have full access to all the cards to begin with, meaning that buying draft packs is often seen as expensive and unnecessary. As a solution to this, some players try to organise a “cube” for drafting in Netrunner. This cube contains a number of cards that player draft with, and then return the cards at the end. For more information about cube drafting, check out this article by Stimhack: <a href="http://stimhack.com/cube-drafting-101/">http://stimhack.com/cube-drafting-101</a></p>

<h3><b>Alright I get that, but what does that have to do with Shi.Kyu?</b></h3>

<p>Shi.Kyu offers a completely new style of drafting to Netrunner. This is how it works.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The draft organiser builds a cube and uploads the list to NetrunnerDB.com ( or uses one of the many prebuilt cubes)</li>
    <li>The organiser sends out the unique Cube ID generated by netrunnerdb to everyone before the draft event, and also specifies the conditions.</li>
    <li>Each player performs the draft for both the Corp and the Runner, and builds those decks before the event. </li>
    <li>Everyone gathers at the event with their pre-built decks and has a good time.</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Sounds pretty good, what’s the pros and the cons of this style of drafting:</b></h3>

<p><b>The Good:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Draft organisers don’t need to build a cube of cards manually, or have to worry about their own cards getting damaged.</li>
    <li>Draft organisers don’t need multiple copies of some data packs/big box expansions if they want to have more than 3 cards in a cube.</li>
    <li>Draft participants don’t have to fork out cash for draft packs</li>
    <li>Draft participants have as much time as they want to decide on the cards they want</li>
    <li>Draft participants can export their decklists to share around with others.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The Bad:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Shi.Kyu drafts are all single player, meaning that the aspect of denying cards to other players is removed. </li>
</ul>

<h3><b>What do all these options mean?</b></h3>

<p>With Shi.kyu, the number of options is designed to give draft organisers the ability to customise the draft experience as much as they want. These options include:</p>


<ul>
    <li>Two main draft modes: Traditional and Grid drafting. Traditional drafting involves selecting a single card from a selection. Grid drafting creates a 3x3 grid, which players select a single row or column.</li>
    <li>AI Players: All drafting modes feature the option to include AI opponents who will draft cards against you. Include these opponents if you force more interesting decisions on your draft participants.</li>
    <li>Customisable size options for both the number of packs to draft with, and the number of cards in each pack.</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>What’s the plan for the future?</b></h3>
<p>Shi.kyu is currently an experiment in new draft modes for Living Card Games. If this website gets popular, there are plans to extend the functionality.</p>

<p>Some options include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Online Multiplayer drafting,</li>
    <li>Advanced AI,</li>
    <li>Real Time statistics on cards you’ve chosen,</li>
    <li>Better performance and display on mobile devices (it works, but I wouldn't recommend it),</li>
    <li>More export options. Currently the only option is .txt files,</li>
    <li>A custom deck building graphical user interface,</li>
    <li>Support for other LCG’s.</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Who are you?</b></h3>

<p>Me? I am just a Netrunner fan living in Brisbane, Australia. I’ve been playing Netrunner since Creation and Control. Shi.kyu is a project that I started out of my love of the game, and is completely unaffiliated with Fantasy Flight Games.</p>

<p>If you like what I do here, a small donation towards hosting fees and services would go a long way in keeping this site running for other people to enjoy.</p>
